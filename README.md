# Spring Security Framework

This repository provides an introduction to the **Spring Security Framework** and demonstrates the implementation of authentication and authorization in Spring applications. The project covers various security aspects like securing endpoints, user roles, password encryption, and more, using Spring Security configurations.

## Features

- User authentication and authorization
- Securing REST endpoints
- Role-based access control
- Password encryption and validation
- Custom login and error handling pages

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**
- **Spring Security**
- **Maven** for dependency management
- **Java 11** or higher

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- JDK 11 or higher
- Maven
- IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, etc.)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShrunalNimje/Spring-Security-Framework.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory**

   ```bash
   cd Spring-Security-Framework

3. **Build the project using Maven**

   ```bash
   mvn clean install

4. **Run the application**
   
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run

### Usage
Once the application is up and running, it will prompt for login credentials to access secured endpoints. Use configured roles and users to test access control:

- **Admin Role:** Access to all secured endpoints.
- **User Role:** Limited access based on configurations.
